About the Android Applications -

Math Puzzle Alarm
This is an application that enables the user to set an alarm for a desired time of the day. The user gets an option to select the time in a 24 hour format. When the alarm starts to ring, the user needs to answer a set of questions to stop the alarm tone. The alarm is particularly useful for people who find it difficult to wake up from sleep.
The number of questions and the difficulty level can be set by the user through a Setting activity and AppPreferences activity. The alarm turns into a normal alarm when the number of questions to be answered are set to zero.
